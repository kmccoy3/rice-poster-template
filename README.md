# Rice University Template

This is a fork of the Gemini Beamer poster theme to include official Rice University logos and colors. Many files have been removed to make usage simpler. See original repository for full documentation.

## Usage

1. In `poster.tex`, set up your paper size, column layout, and scale the
   content as necessary

1. Make sure you are using LuaLaTeX as your compiler. That's it!
